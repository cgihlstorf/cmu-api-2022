# cmu-api-2022

Repository for code and scripts of the API Knowledge graph Project. Currently contains three files: a file with functions to extract Tensorflow and PyTorch functions from Python code (in progress) and two Python files to test this code on, one with Tensorflow function calls and one with PyTorch function calls.
