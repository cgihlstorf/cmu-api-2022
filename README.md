# cmu-api-2022

Collection of files from several software engineering projects I was involved in at CMU during the summer of 2022.

Contains:
1) Scripts to extract API functions from Python code and filter and extract Python files from a directory. Also includes test files for each script.
2) reuse2022, a folder of files for my larger project of using a large language model to predict Python code using function docstrings. The project's goal is to see if LLMs serve as decent proxies to determining the usefulness of function documentation.
